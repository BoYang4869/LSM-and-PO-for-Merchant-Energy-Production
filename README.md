# Pathwise-Optimization-for-Merchant-Energy-Production
This repo provides a C++ implementation of pathwise optimization in the context of merchant energy production. Specifically, we consider a realistic ethanol production instance with 24 monthly stages. The ethanol production plant converts corn and natural gas into ethanol. The decision maker (owner)'s goal is to maximize the total profit whiling facing volatile commodity prices. The code applies the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to the ethanol production instance modeled as a large scale pathwise linear program. The output are lower and dual bounds as well as a control policy.
