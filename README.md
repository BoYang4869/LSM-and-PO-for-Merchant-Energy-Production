# Pathwise-Optimization-for-Merchant-Energy-Production
This repo provides a C++ implementation of pathwise optimization in the context of merchant energy production. The code applies the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to a realistic ethanol production instance modeled as a large scale pathwise linear program. The output are lower and dual bounds as well as a control policy.
